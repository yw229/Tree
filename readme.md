Implement a function to check if a tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that no two leaf nodes differ in distance from the root by more than one.

Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.

Given a sorted (increasing order) array, write an algorithm to create a binary tree with minimal height.

Given a binary search tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (i.e., if you have a tree with depth D, you¡¯ll have D linked lists).

Write an algorithm to find the ¡®next¡¯ node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree where each node has a link to its parent.
